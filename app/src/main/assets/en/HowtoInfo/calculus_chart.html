		<h2 style="color:blue">Scientific Calculator Plus Help : Calculate integral, derivative and generate chart</h2>
		<p style="color:black">Theoretically, Scientific Calculator Plus is able to support any level integral calculation by reversely calling built-in integrate function. However, the internal integration tool only supports triple integration to avoid complexity. Using this tool, user needs to input the expression to be integrated, e.g. <i>2 + 3* x</i>. Then user inputs the integrating variable name, in the example it is <i>x</i>. And then user types variable changing range, for example, from <i>3 + i</i> to <i>100 -9i</i>. The number of integration steps determines accuracy of the calculation. Lager number of steps leads to more accurate result however longer calculating time. Generally 100 integration steps have been enough. If the number of steps is zero or empty, Scientific Calculator Plus employs adaptive Gauss-Kronrod method to calculate integral which is more accurate for high-frequency functions. But it may be slow in some extreme cases.</p>
		<p style="color:black">Scientific Calculator Plus is also able to calculate indefinite integral. Note that not all the expressions can be indefinitely integrated. Moreover, some expressions may be too complicated to solve. In this case, Scientific Calculator Plus will throw an exception telling user that it cannot get result.</p>
		<p style="color:black">Scientific Calculator Plus includes the function to calculate derivative expression and derivative value. It is able to calculate first, second and third derivatives of a given expression based on a variable (at a given value). If the variable's value is not set, derivative expression is given. Otherwise, derivative value is given.</p>
		<p style="color:black">Scientific Calculator Plus has an internal tool to plot 2D chart. This tool supports at most eight 2D curves. User is able to add new curve by clicking "Add Curve" button or delete an existing curve by clicking "Delete Curve" button. For each curve, both <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> values are a function of variable <i>t</i> whose value range is set by user. For example, <i>t</i> is from -50 to 50 and the length of step is 0.1, expression of <i>X</i> is <i>3 + t**2</i> and expression of <i>Y</i> is <i>cos(t - 9)</i>. Please note that this plotting tool actually calls a built-in function named plot_2d_curves to draw charts. If user wants calculator to detect singular point(s) (i.e. x or y is infinite), step field should be left as blank so that auto step is choosen. After a chart is plotted, user is able to freely scale and shift the chart.</p>
		<p style="color:black">Scientific Calculator Plus has an internal tool to plot polar chart. This tool supports at most eight polar curves. User is able to add new curve by clicking "Add Curve" button or delete an existing curve by clicking "Delete Curve" button. For each curve, both <i>r</i> and <i>θ</i> values are a function of variable <i>t</i> whose value range is set by user. For example, <i>t</i> is from 0 to <i>PI*2</i> and the length of step is <i>PI/8</i>, expression of <i>r</i> is <i>cos(t)</i> and expression of <i>θ</i> is <i>t</i>. Please note that this plotting tool actually calls a built-in function named plot_polar_curves to draw charts. If user wants calculator to detect singular point(s) (i.e. <i>r</i> or <i>θ</i> is infinite), step field should be left as blank so that auto step is choosen. After a chart is plotted, user is able to freely scale and shift the chart.</p>
		<p style="color:black">Scientific Calculator Plus has an internal tool to plot 3D chart. This tool supports at most four 3D surface curves. User is able to add new curve by clicking "Add Curve" button or delete an existing curve by clicking "Delete Curve" button. For each curve, <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i> values are a function of variables <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> whose value ranges are set by user. For example, <i>u</i> is from -50 to 50 and the length of step is 10, <i>v</i> is from 0 to 150 and the length of step is 15, expression of <i>X</i> is <i>cos(u)*sin(v)</i>, expression of <i>Y</i> is <i>cos(u)*cos(v)</i> and expression of <i>Z</i> is <i>sin(u)</i>. Please note that this plotting tool actually calls a built-in function named plot_3d_surfaces to draw charts. After a chart is plotted, user is able to freely scale, rotate and shift the chart.</p>
