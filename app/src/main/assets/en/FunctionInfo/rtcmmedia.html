<td><p>::mfp::multimedia::webrtc_lib::link_video_stream(4) :</p>
<p>This function links a web RTC video stream to a RTC video output window. It has four parameters. The first one is a display handle, which is returned from an open_screen_display call. The second one is a peer connection object's Id. The third one is video stream's track Id. The last one is video output window index. This function doesn't return anything. If any parameters are invalid, or it fails to link video stream to the video output window, an exception is thrown.</p>

<td><center>receive_rtc_mmedia_message</center></td>
<td><p>::mfp::multimedia::webrtc_lib::receive_rtc_mmedia_message(1) :</p>
<p>This function retrieves a web RTC message. Note that web RTC here is the web RTC library for voice and video communication, not the same thing as the WEBRTC protocol for data communication. It has only one parameter which is the expiry time. If this parameter is a positive value, this function blocks and waits for the number of milliseconds. If this parameter is 0, this function returns immediately. Otherwise, this function waits indefinitely until a message is available. If after waiting no message is available, this function returns null. Otherwise, it returns a four element array whose first element is message's destination peer connection Id, second element is RTC session Id, third element is message type and last element is message content. If this message is a RTC signal, message type should be "signal" and message content should be a Json string whose "type" field is signal type, i.e. "offer", "answer" or "candidate"; and, if signal type is "offer" or "answer", "sdp" field is sdp content. If this message is a peer connection event, message type should be "pc" and message content is a Json based string whose "type" field is peer connection event type, e.g. "ice_connection_change"; and "content" field is string based content of the event.</p>
