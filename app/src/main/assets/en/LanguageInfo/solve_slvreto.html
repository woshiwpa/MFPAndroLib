<h2 style="color:blue">MFP language solve and slvreto statements:</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
Solve statement starts an in-line solver block. It takes an arbitary number of variables as parameters. These variables must be declared before. These variables will be the to-be-solved variables in the solve block. In the following example, user first defines three variables x, y and z, then starts a solve block to solve the values of variables x, y and z.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">variable x = 3, y, z = [2, 7]</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">solve x, y, z</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">...</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
It doesn't matter what the initial values of x, y and z are. If in the solve block x, y or z is solved it will be assigned a new value. If the solve block cannot solve any or all of the variables, the value of the variable(s) does not change.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
Slvreto statement finishes an in-line solver block. It has one optional parameter, a variable declared before the solve block. This variable is used to store all the roots of each to-be-solved variables (i.e. variables as parameters in solve statement). However, to retrive roots of a variable or a result set, user should use built-in functions including <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_num_of_results_sets</a>, <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_solved_results_set</a> and <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_variable_results</a>. For example, the following statements are all valid:</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">slvreto</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">slvreto all_results</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
The follows are a solve example.</p>
<pre style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">
Function testtry2()
	Variable a, b, c, x, y, z
	a = 3
	b = 4
	c = 5
	x = 6
	y = 7
	z = 8
	solve x, y, z 	<i style="font-family:verdana;color:green;">// x, y and z are to-be-solved variables in the solve block.</i>
		<i style="font-family:verdana;color:green;">// a, b and c are also used in the solve block.
		// However, different from x, y and z, they are
		// not to solve variables so that their values

		a * x**2 + 7 * log(b) *x + 6.5 == 8 <i style="font-family:verdana;color:green;">// note that '==' should be used
											// instead of '=' because '='
											// assigns value to a variable.</i>
		y * b - z + 6 == 3.7 + x/(a + 7)
		y * x + z/(c - 3) == 6 + a + y

	<i style="font-family:verdana;color:green;">// it's possible that MFP cannot solve the expressions in a solve block. In

	if (get_num_of_results_sets(a) > 0)
		
		<i style="font-family:verdana;color:green;">// 0 means the first results set, 1 means the second, etc.</i>
		print("\nResults set No. 2 is " + get_solved_results_set(a, 1))
		
		<i style="font-family:verdana;color:green;">// note that get_variable_results has two parameters, first is solve

		print("\nAll results of y are " + get_variable_results(a, 1))

<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
In the above example, we get
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
x == 0.14781939
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
y == 6.84549421
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
z == 29.66719489
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
Number of results sets is 2
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
Results set No. 2 is [-3.38250623, -3.22386342, -10.25720306]
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
All results of y are [6.84549421, -3.22386342] .
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
To write a solve block, user needs to know the following things:
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
1. There are two types of variables in a solve block, normal variables and to-be-solved variables. To-be-solved variables are the variables in the solve statement definition. In the above example, to-be-solved variables are x, y and z while a, b and c are normal variables. Values of normal variables are known to solve block while values of to-be-solved variables will be assigned in a solve block. Also, both normal variables and to-be-solved variables should be declared before a solve block.
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
2. To set up a to-be-solved expression in a solve block, '==' should be used instead of '=' since '=' is to assign value to a variable. However, it is fine if user assigns value to a variable (whether normal or to-be-solved) in a solve block. An example is:
</p>
<pre style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">
variable a = 3, b = 4, c = 5, x, y
solve x, y
	a * x + y / c == 9
	c = 7
	y * b - x * c  == 6
slvreto
</pre>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
In the above example, if we comment the line c = 7, we actually solve an expression group which includes 3 * x + y / 5 == 9 and y * 4 - x * 5 == 6. But if we have the line c = 7, we actually solve an expression group which includes 3 * x + y / 5 == 9 and y * 4 - x * 7 == 6.
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
If user assigns value to a to-be-solved variable, this to-be-solved variable is no longer unknown so that it becomes a normal variable. However, user has to be very careful because assigning may affect expressions before it. An example is:
</p>
<pre style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">
variable a = 3, b = 4, c = 5, x, y
solve x, y
	a * x + y / c == 9
	x = 7
	y * b - x * c  == 6
slvreto
</pre>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
In the above example, if we comment the line x = 7, we actually solve an expression group which includes 3 * x + y / 5 == 9 and y * 4 - x * 5 == 6. But if we have the line x = 7, we actually solve a single expression which is y * 4 - 7 * 5 == 6. This is because, clearly, MFP cannot solve x and y values only from the first expression a * x + y / c == 9 so it goes to the next statement. In the second statement, x is assigned a value, which is 7, and becomes a normal variable. In the third statement, variables b, c and x are normal variables with valid value so that MFP uses their values and gets that y should be 10.25. Then MFP goes back to the first expression a * x + y / c == 9. But now both x and y become normal variables and have known values so that MFP uses their values and simplifies the expression to 3 * 7 + 10.25 / 5 == 9. This is a compare expression and its value is FALSE. In this way, MFP solves x should be 7 and y should be 10.25.
</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
3. We can see all the roots of all the variables are stored in the returned variable in slvreto statement. In current MFP language, the returned variable is actually a 2-D matrix, each row is a root set for every variable. However, <b>please note that in the future the data structure of solve returned value may change</b>. As such make sure to use functions provided by system (i.e. <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_num_of_results_sets</a>, <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_solved_results_set</a>, <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_variable_results</a>, etc.) to obtain the roots. After solve block finishes, the value of each to-be-solved variable is the root of this variable in the first root set. Only exception is that in the first root set this variable cannot be solved.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
MFP in-line solver is not almighty. It is possible that MFP cannot solve some mathematic expressions. In this case, slvreto returns empty result to its returned variable. Function <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_num_of_results_sets</a> returns zero. The to-be-solved variables keep their original values before solve block. It is also possible that some to-be-solved variables are solved while others cannot be solved. In this case, the unsolved to-be-solved variables keep their original values before solve block. If we use <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_solved_results_set</a> or <a href="../FunctionInfo/solver.html" target="_self">get_variable_results</a> function to obtain the unsolved variable values, we get NULL.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
4. The number of results sets returned by solve block is determined by multiplying number of roots of each individual to-be-solved variable. For example,
</p>
<pre style="font-family:verdana;color:blue;">
variable x, y, z
solve x, y
	log(x) == 3
	y**3 + 3 * y**2 + 3 * y+ 1 == 0
slvreto z
</pre>
<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
returns three sets of results. All of them are [20.08553692318766792368478490971028804779052734375, -1]. This is because y**3 + 3 * y**2 + 3 * y+ 1 == 0 has three roots but with same value. Although log(x) == 3 has only one root, each y root should has a corresponding x value so that we get three sets of results.
